## The green Open Access version of the second CDK paper.

The [second paper](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpd/2006/00000012/00000017/art00005)
was published in [Current Pharmaceutical Design](http://benthamscience.com/journals/current-pharmaceutical-design/)

was is not (CC-BY) Open Access. However, SHERPA/RoMEO [reports](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php?issn=1381-6128)
that I post-print versions can be archived (just not as the publisher PDF). So here goes...

# Recent Developments of the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) - An Open-Source Java Library for Chemo- and Bioinformatics

Steinbeck, Christoph; Hoppe, Christian; Kuhn, Stefan; Floris, Matteo; Guha, Rajarshi; Willighagen, Egon L.

## Abstract

The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) provides methods for common tasks in molecular informatics, including 2D and 3D rendering of chemical structures, I/O routines, SMILES parsing and generation, ring searches, isomorphism checking, structure diagram generation, etc. Implemented in Java, it is used both for server-side computational services, possibly equipped with a web interface, as well as for applications and client-side applets. This article introduces the CDK's new QSAR capabilities and the recently introduced interface to statistical software.

## Introduction

Chemoinformatics is a scientific discipline, which attempts to solve problems in chemistry with methods devel-
oped in computer science. This rather broad definition by
Johann Gasteiger [1] covers a number of overlapping topics
from a diverse set of fields - including mathematics, statistics, computer science, pattern recognition and machine
learning - applied to creating, processing and understanding
chemical information. Examples of chemoinformatics applications include characterization of molecular structures using
graph theoretical methods, detecting structure property
trends using neural networks and other statistical methods
and applications of efficient algorithms to detect substructures. With the advent of high throughput methods such as
high throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry, the
demands â€“ in terms of greater speed as well as greater accuracy - made on chemoinformatics methods and tools have
increased.

Though the term, chemoinformatics, may have been
coined recently, work in this field has been in progress for
the last 20 years and the benefits made available to the drug
development and design community from this field have
resulted in it becoming an area for commercial ventures. A
whole software industry focused specifically on pharmaceutical chemoinformatics (such as, but not limited to, [2-4]), is
now competing for a rather small market.
In the academic community a lot of research has been
done in isolated areas of chemoinformatics, but for a long
time no attempt was made to create a general purpose, publicly available software package to support even the most
prominent areas. Recently, this situation has changed significantly. The enormous progress made in the molecular sci-
ences such as large scale genomics, proteomics and metabolomics projects has only been possible because it was
supported by a bioinformatics software culture of openness.
